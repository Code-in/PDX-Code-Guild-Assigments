    <h2>
        <p><a href="https://witcher.fandom.com/wiki/Dandelion/Netflix_series">Jaskier</a>, was a bard and a close friend of Geralt of Rivia.</p>

        <p>After getting booed during his performance at a local tavern, Jaskier approached Geralt of Rivia and insisted that he review his performance. Geralt told Jaskier that the creatures in his song didn't exist, and Jaskier realized that he was a witcher, which he announced to the bar. A patron named Nettly overheard and offered to pay Geralt 100 ducats if he killed the "devil" that was stealing their grain. Geralt agreed to kill the devil, and Jaskier invited himself along, during which time he offered to help improve Geralt's image, so that he was no longer seen as a monstrous killer.</p>

        <p>While hunting this "devil", Jaskier and Geralt were attacked by a Sylvan named Torque. It threw a stone at Jaskier and knocked him out. It then charged at Geralt, knocking him to the ground. Torque charged for a second time, but this time Geralt grabbed him by the horns and slammed him to the ground. To his surprise, it could talk. Rather than killing Torque, Geralt showed mercy, allowing him to live, but only if he left. However, someone snuck up behind Geralt and knocked him out too.</p>

        <p>Jaskier and Geralt woke up in a cave, tied back-to-back with each other and surrounded by elves. They were repeatedly hit by a sickly elf named Toruviel. Geralt waited until she got close enough, and headbutted her. They were joined by Torque and the elven monarch, Filavandrel. Torque had been stealing food and medicine for them ever since they were forced out of Dol Blathanna. Jaskier was shocked, as he was under the impression that the elves willingly left to return to their "golden palaces," when in reality they retreated to simple caves. Unfortunately, they couldn't allow Jaskier and Geralt to leave in fear that Posada would learn that they had been stealing, causing the humans to attack, which would undoubtedly result in casualties on both sides. In the efforts of self-preservation, Filavandrel knew he must kill them. Filavandrel's elders worked with humans and got robbed of all they had, and when they fought back, they were slaughtered in a battle that would come to be known as the "Great Cleansing." Bringing his people down from the mountains would mean bowing down to the humans, and would make them slaves. Geralt advised them to rebuild elsewhere and grow in numbers. Filavandrel had a change of heart and decided to let Jaskier and Geralt go.</p>

        <p>Jaskier and Geralt left the mountains, having been released by Filavandrel. In return, Geralt gave them the 150 ducats he was paid to kill Torque. In this adventure, Jaskier had gained a newfound respect for Filavandrel. They survived the Great Cleansing once. Maybe they could do it again. Jaskier started to sing a tune while Geralt followed alongside.</p>
